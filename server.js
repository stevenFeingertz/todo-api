/*
	MongoDB Notes
	The mongodb db is not an application, it's a directory of executables. I placed it in my user (stevenFeingertz) folder. I then created a folder in the same directory called 'mongo-data'.

	To start the db, I navigate to the bin directory of mongo db and type './mongod --dbpath ~/mongo-data'. I have to tell the db where the data is being stored.

	I can also user robomongo application to get a gui interface for mongo db
